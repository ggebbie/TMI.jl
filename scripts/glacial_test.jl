% Example : Find the distribution of a tracer given:              %
%       (a) the pathways described by A,                          %
%       (b) interior sources and sinks given by dC,               % 
%           that best fits observations, Cobs,                    %
%   and (c) inequality constraints on the tracer concentration.   %
%                                                                  %
% Mathematically, minimize J = (C-Cobs)^T W (C-Cobs) subject to    %
%                         AC = d + Gamma u                         %
%  where u is the estimated change in surface concentration.    %
